  <p>
     Hi! I'm an incoming 26 fall PhD student in <a href="https://westlake-encode-lab.github.io/">ENCODE Lab</a> at Westlake University, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.huanwang.tech/">Prof. Huan Wang</a>. I obtained my M.Eng. in Communication Engineering from Beihang University in 2025 and B.Eng. in Communication Engineering at Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2022.

    Currently, my research centers on Efficient AI and Large Language Models, including model pruning and post-training quantization.
